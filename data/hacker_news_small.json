{"comment_text": "It may come as a surprise to people who read lots of startup news, because you tend to only hear about the successes, but generally it is not very easy to disrupt any business, or even become a millionaire. Achieving those for e.g. laundry might not make the world a much better place, but it is still quite an achievement.<p>The other side of this &quot;wholly unnecessary&quot;-business, is that with rising standards of living, necessities are already fairly well provided for, so it is quite obvious that any future desired consumer good will be mostly in the unnecessary category. A funny read about these types of things is &quot;The Idea of Luxury: A Conceptual and Historical Investigation&quot; by Christopher J. Berry, where he describes 18th century philosophers discussing what is luxury (i.e unnecessary) and what is necessity.

{"comment_text": "No it&#x27;s not. A company being profitable is different than a company turning a profit specifically for it&#x27;s initial investors. The profitability of a company post-buyout is murky. We&#x27;re also talking about VCs getting in on profitable businesses ventures, not tech conglomerates. If a VC makes their money by finding hot trending startups that later get bought out, they&#x27;re not really investing in a company that profits on the merits of the business plan alone. A lot of the big buyouts are based on buzz, and often the valuations are overblown when compared to actual ability to profit.
